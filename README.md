Implementation of [Learning Deep Representation for Trajectory Clustering](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/exsy.12252)

This is **NOT** the official implementation.
The code is implemented as one competitor of [Trajectory Similarity Learning with Auxiliary Supervision and Optimal Matching](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/0444.pdf). 
The problem definition is not exactly same as the original paper, some structure has changed to fit our setting, so this implementation may **NOT** work as expected.
